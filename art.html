        Ashik music is a type of ballad singing that is popular in Turkmenistan and other parts of Central Asia. <br>
        It features solo vocalists accompanied by instruments such as the dutar, and often tells stories of love, war, and other themes. <br>
        Classical music has a long history in Turkmenistan and is often associated with courtly life. <br>

        It is a traditional instrument with a long neck, a pear-shaped body covered by a thin wooden sounding board, and two strings. <br>

      The gyjak is an upright instrument with three or four strings, played using a bow made of horsehair. <br>
      It is often crafted from a blend of apricot and mulberry wood and creates a sound that may remind you of the ever-changing Kara Kum desert or a prolonged screech. <br>
      Typically, it is played as an accompaniment to the dutar. <br>

      Turkmen literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Old Oghuz Turkic and Turkmen languages. <br>
      The Turkmens are direct descendants of the Oghuz Turks, who were a western Turkic people, who formed the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family. <br>
      The earliest development of Turkmen literature is closely associated with the literature of the Oghuz Turks. <br>
      Turkmens have joint claims to a number of literary works written in Old Oghuz and Persian (by Seljuks in the 11-12th centuries) <br>
      languages with other people of the Oghuz Turkic origin, mainly of Azerbaijan and Turkey. <br>
      These works include, among others, the Book of Dede Korkut, Gorogly, "Layla and Majnun", and "Yusuf Zulaikha". <br>
      <br>
      There is a consensus, however, that distinctively modern Turkmen literature originated in the 18th century with the poetry of Magtymguly Pyragy. <br>
      He is considered the father of Turkmen literature. Other prominent Turkmen poets of that era are Döwletmämmet Azady (Magtymguly's father), <br>
      Nurmuhammet Andalyp, Abdylla Şabende, Şeýdaýy, Mahmyt Gaýyby and Gurbanally Magrupy. <br>

    The 18th and 19th centuries are considered the era when Turkmen poetry flourished, marked by the appearance of poets <br>
    including Azady, Andalyp, Pyragy, Şeýdaýy, Zelili, and Gaýyby. Döwletmämmet Azady is known for his religious and <br>
    didactic treatise Wagzy Azat, written in the form of individual poems and short tales, <br>
    as well as the poem "Jabyr Ensar" and lyric poems. <br>
    The poet Andalyp, who lived at the same time, is the author of lyric works and novels such as Yusup and Zulaikha, <br>
    Laila and Majnun, and Sagd-Vekas. The language of the poetry of Azady <br>
    and Andalyp is far from the folk language and is oriented towards the canons of oriental court poetry. <br>

    Magtymguly Pyragy was a Turkmen spiritual leader, philosophical poet, Sufi and traveller who is considered the most famous figure in Turkmen literary history. <br>
    Magtymguly is the greatest representative of Turkmen literature, credited with the creation of Turkmen written literature, <br>
    and whose literary form became a powerful symbol of the historical and the incipient national consciousness of the Turkmen people. <br>
    He is part of a unique period in the cultural history of Central Asia, with his exceptional talent projecting his personal poetic synthesis onto the next generation of poets of the region. <br>
    In a wider context, Magtymguly is often placed alongside major figures of the Turkic literary world such as Hoja Ahmad Yasawi, Yunus Emre, Ali-Shir Nava'i and Fizuli. <br>
