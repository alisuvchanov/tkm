            Turkmen rug is a kind of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally developing around Central Asia. <br>
            The authentic Turkmen rugs were made by the Turkmen tribes who are the main ethnic group <br>
            in Turkmenistan as well as also found in Afghanistan and Iran. <br>
            They are used for different purposes, such as tent rugs, door hangings, and bags of various sizes. <br>
            <br> 
            Turkmen carpets are known for their complex and quality of the wool used in their production. <br>
            The carpet weaving tradition in Turkmenistan dates back many centuries of the country's cultural heritage. <br>
            Turkmen carpets are highly valued by collectors and are often used as wall ha[unreadable] hes and public buildings. <br>
            The unique patterns and use of natural dyes make Turkmen carpets stand out, <br>
            and they are considered among the finest examples of traditional rug-making in the world. <br>
            Traditional Turkmen carpet-making craft has been inscribed on the list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in 2019. <br>

            Carpets, mostly in deep red color, and featuring a repeated motif known as a Gul means the flower, <br>
            are a great source of pride to the Turkmen. <br>
            They were among the most precious possessions of Turkmen nomads, the walls and floors of whose yurts were decorated with carpets. <br>
            Turkmenistan celebrates an annual Carpet Day, <br>
            and the national flag incorporates the flower typical of carpets from each of the country's five regions. <br>
            <br>
            The flower is, in effect, an emblem of the tribe. <br>
            There is much debate as to the meaning of each of the patterns. <br>
            If you visit Ashgabat Carpet muses, the guides will explain to you the very everything about Turkmen carpets. <br>
            For instance, the flower characteristics of the Tekke tribe are divided into four parts to represent the seasons, <br>
            its alternating white and dark colors symbolizing day and night. <br>
            <br>
            Within each of the four parts, the three designs resembling a flower. <br>
            The four colors used in the making of the carpet month, which makes the whole design a kind of calendar are said to represent the elements, <br>
            respectively, of earth, air, fire, and water. <br>
            The guides identify in the flower of the Yomud tribe, which occupies the Caspian shores of western Turkmenistan, many marine-related items. <br>
            Thus the elongated shape of the flower is said to represent a boat, or possibly a fish, and the design features repeated anchor shapes. <br>
            Around the edges of Yomud carpets may be identified a pattern resembling seashells intertwined with seaweed. <br>

          One Tekke carpet measures 193m² and weighs a tonne and was made by some 40 people in 1941 to make a curtain for the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. 
          Another, made in 2001, is even larger, measuring 301m² and 14 by 21.2 metres and was made to commemorate 10 years of Turkmen independence from the Soviet Union.
