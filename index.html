                    Amyderýa is a major river in Central Asia, which flows through Tajikistan, Türkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. <br>
                    It is the second longest river in Central Asia, after the Syr Darya and was made by junction of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers. <br>

                Türkmenistan has a unique and remarkable history. <br>
                The territory of present-day Türkmenistan has been inhabited since the Stone Age, <br>
                with evidence of agricultural communities as early as 6000 BC <br>
                and of planned irrigation works from 3500 BC. The first states were Margiana and Parthia, from about 1000 BC. <br>
                In 7th-6th centuries BC, Margiana was part of Bactria, while Parthia was part of the Median state. <br>
                In the 6th-4th centuries BC the region was ruled by the Achaemenids... <br>
                Shortly the territory of what is now Türkmenistan provided the bedrock for many of the most powerful empires of their age. <br> 
                The Parthians, Oguzlar ancestors of Seljuks and the Khans of Khoresm all based their empires at various points on the edge of the Kara-Kum Desert. <br>
                <br>
                Modern Türkmenistan was radically transformed by the invasion of the Russian Empire, <br>
                which conquered and annexed the region in the late 19th century. <br>
                Later, the Russian Revolution of 1917, <br>
                Türkmenistan would transform from an Islamic society to an urbanist Leninist socialist republic during the Soviet era. <br>
                Independence would come in year 1991 when Saparmurat Niyazov became president of newly independent Türkmenistan.
