    <b>
      The Alabai dog breed has a long and storied history in the region, including Turkmenistan. <br>
      Here is a brief overview of the history of the Alabai in Turkmenistan: <br>
      <br>
      Origin: The Alabai breed is believed to have originated in Central Asia, including Turkmenistan, thousands of years ago. <br>
      They are descendants of ancient Molossian dogs that were used for guarding and protecting livestock. <br>
      <br>  
      Nomadic Tribes: Alabai dogs were traditionally used by Turkmen nomadic tribes for various purposes, <br>
      including guarding livestock such as sheep and goats, protecting camps and settlements, <br>
      and serving as loyal companions to the nomads. <br>
      <br>
      Selective Breeding: Over generations, Turkmen nomads selectively bred the Alabai for specific traits such as strength, <br> 
      loyalty, and protective instincts. This selective breeding led to the development of the breed as we know it today. <br>
      <br>
      Symbol of Heritage: In Turkmenistan, the Alabai is not just a working dog but also a symbol of national pride and heritage. <br>
      The breed is deeply ingrained in Turkmen culture and is highly valued for its role in protecting both livestock and families. <br>
      <br>
      Modern Day: Today, Alabai dogs continue to be popular in Turkmenistan and are used for a variety of purposes, <br>
      including guarding homes, working on farms, and serving as loyal companions. <br>
      The breed's strong protective instincts and loyalty make them a beloved part of many Turkmen households. <br>

        This breed presents a robust dog of greater than average size with great strength and power. <br>
        They are independent, curious and alert, yet imperturbable. The dog is as long as it is tall at the withers, <br>
        or slightly longer than its height. The hair is short or moderately long with a heavy undercoat. <br>
        Its ears are, in practice, cropped very short, and the tail is docked moderately long. <br>
        Most common colors are black/white; fawn of different shades, from almost white to deep red; brindle. <br>
        Some have a black mask. <br>
        <br>
        The head is very solid, without pronounced stop or sculls. <br>
        The neck is low set, short, with dewlap. The body is fairly broad, proportionate, muscles rather flat. <br>
        The ribcage appears very long because of developed false ribs. <br>
        The legs are straight, with heavy boning and moderate yet defined angulation. <br>
        Leg bones must be in proportion, and shall never give the impression that any bone is short. <br>
        The rump is broad. The typical gait is a gallop; however CAO can trot for hours without wearing themselves out. <br>
        <br>  
        The Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wrote a book about the animal and in 2017, <br>
        presented Russian President Vladimir Putin with Verni, a puppy, as a birthday present. <br>
